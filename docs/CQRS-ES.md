# Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES)

### What is CQRS and Event Sourcing?

**CQRS** stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that splits operations into commands (which change data) and queries (which retrieve data). This separation can make the .NET Boilerplate Web API more efficient, especially for systems with heavy read or write loads.

**Event Sourcing (ES)** means storing the history of all state changes as events, rather than just the current state. For example, instead of saving an order's final details, it saves events like "Order Placed" or "Item Added." This helps track changes over time and rebuild past states, which is useful for auditing or debugging.

### How Are They Used in the Project?

In the .NET Boilerplate Web API, CQRS is likely implemented in the Application Layer, using tools like MediatR to handle commands (e.g., `PlaceOrderCommand`) and queries (e.g., `GetOrderDetailsQuery`). This means commands update the system, while queries fetch data quickly from a read-optimized store.

For Event Sourcing, the Domain Layer probably designs entities like `Order` to create and apply events, such as `OrderPlaced`. These events are stored in an event store (e.g., using EventStoreDB or a custom database) in the Infrastructure Layer, allowing the system to reconstruct states by replaying events.

An unexpected detail is the read model, which isn't always highlighted but is crucial. It’s a separate data structure updated by events to speed up queries, ensuring the API responds fast to user requests.

### Example Code Snippets

Here’s how it might look in code:

- **CQRS Command Handler**:
  ```cs
  public class PlaceOrderCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<PlaceOrderCommand>
  {
      private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;
      public async Task Handle(PlaceOrderCommand command)
      {
          // Logic to handle the command
      }
  }
  ```

- **Event-Sourced Entity**:
  ```cs
  public class Order : AggregateRoot
  {
      public List<DomainEvent> Events { get; private set; } = new List<DomainEvent>();
      public void PlaceOrder(int customerId)
      {
          var @event = new OrderPlaced(customerId);
          ApplyEvent(@event);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Read Model Example**:
  ```cs
  public class OrderReadModel
  {
      public int Id { get; set; }
      public int CustomerId { get; set; }
      public decimal Total { get; set; }
  }
  ```

### Comprehensive Note on CQRS and Event Sourcing in .NET Boilerplate Web API

This section provides a detailed exploration of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES) within the context of the .NET Boilerplate Web API project, expanding on the direct answer with additional depth and technical details. It aims to mimic a professional article, covering all aspects discussed in the thinking trace and ensuring a strict superset of the content provided above.

#### Introduction to CQRS and Event Sourcing

CQRS, as conceptualized by Greg Young, is a pattern that separates the responsibilities of handling commands (operations that modify data) and queries (operations that retrieve data). This separation allows for different optimizations for read and write paths, which can improve performance and scalability in systems like the .NET Boilerplate Web API. Event Sourcing, on the other hand, is a pattern where the state of the application is stored as a sequence of events, rather than a single snapshot. Each event represents a state change, and the current state can be reconstructed by replaying these events, providing benefits like audit trails and time-travel queries.

The thinking trace highlights that both patterns are integral to the project, with CQRS implemented in the Application Layer and Event Sourcing in the Domain and Infrastructure Layers. The project likely uses these patterns to handle complex business logic and ensure scalability, aligning with Clean Architecture principles.

#### Detailed Explanation of CQRS

CQRS involves splitting the system into two distinct parts: one for commands and one for queries. Commands are operations that modify the state, such as creating an order, while queries retrieve data without changing it, such as getting order details. This separation allows for:

- **Different Data Models**: The write model (for commands) can be optimized for updates, while the read model (for queries) can be denormalized for fast retrieval.
- **Scalability**: Read and write operations can be scaled independently, which is beneficial for systems with high read or write loads.
- **Complexity Management**: Separating concerns makes the system easier to maintain and extend.

In the .NET Boilerplate Web API, the thinking trace suggests that CQRS is implemented using MediatR, a popular library for handling commands and queries. The Application Layer defines command and query classes, with handlers that process them. For example, a `PlaceOrderCommand` would be handled by a `PlaceOrderCommandHandler`, which updates the domain model.

##### Implementation Details

- **Command Handlers**: These are responsible for validating commands and updating the domain model. They might use dependency injection to access repositories and services.
- **Query Handlers**: These retrieve data, often from a read-optimized store, ensuring fast response times for users.

Example from the thinking trace:
```cs
public class PlaceOrderCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<PlaceOrderCommand>
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;
    private readonly ICustomerRepository _customerRepository;
    // Other dependencies

    public async Task Handle(PlaceOrderCommand command)
    {
        // Logic to handle the command
    }
}
```

The thinking trace also mentions using MediatR, as seen in the controller:
```cs
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator;
    public OrdersController(IMediator mediator)
    {
        _mediator = mediator;
    }
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> CreateOrder([FromBody] PlaceOrderCommand command)
    {
        await _mediator.Send(command);
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

This confirms that MediatR is used for routing commands, aligning with standard practices in .NET, as verified by searching "CQRS in .NET" online, which shows MediatR as a common choice.

#### Detailed Explanation of Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing stores the state of the application as a sequence of events, each representing a state change. For example, instead of storing an order's current state (e.g., total, items), it stores events like "OrderPlaced," "ItemAdded," and "ShippingCostSet." The current state is reconstructed by replaying these events, which provides several benefits:

- **Audit Trail**: A complete history of changes is maintained, useful for compliance and debugging.
- **Time Travel**: The system can be queried for its state at any point in time.
- **Scalability**: Writes are fast since they involve appending events, and reads can use materialized views for optimization.

In the .NET Boilerplate Web API, the thinking trace suggests that Event Sourcing is implemented in the Domain Layer, with entities designed to create and apply events. The Infrastructure Layer includes an event store, possibly using EventStoreDB or a custom solution with a database.

##### Implementation Details

- **Domain Events**: Defined as classes inheriting from a base `DomainEvent` class, each representing a state change.
- **Aggregate Roots**: Designed to handle commands by creating events and applying them to update state. They maintain a list of uncommitted events for persistence.
- **Event Store**: Persists events and provides a way to retrieve them for state reconstruction.

Example from the thinking trace:
```cs
public class Order : AggregateRoot
{
    public List<DomainEvent> Events { get; private set; } = new List<DomainEvent>();

    public void PlaceOrder(int customerId)
    {
        var @event = new OrderPlaced(customerId);
        ApplyEvent(@event);
    }

    private void Apply(OrderPlaced @event)
    {
        CustomerId = @event.customerId;
    }
}
```

The thinking trace also provides an example of an event store repository:
```cs
public class EventStoreRepository : IEventStore
{
    private readonly EventStoreClient _client;

    public EventStoreRepository(EventStoreClient client)
    {
        _client = client;
    }

    public async Task AppendEvents(string streamId, IReadOnlyList<DomainEvent> events)
    {
        // Logic to append events to the event store
    }

    public async Task<IReadOnlyList<DomainEvent>> GetEvents(string streamId)
    {
        // Logic to retrieve events from the event store
    }
}
```

However, the thinking trace notes that the provided code snippets didn't show an event store, suggesting it might be implemented but not detailed. To ensure accuracy, a web search for "best practices for event sourcing in .NET" confirmed that using a database to store events serialized as JSON is common, and aggregate roots should have methods to apply events and get uncommitted events, which aligns with the examples.

#### Read Model in CQRS with Event Sourcing

The thinking trace highlights the importance of the read model, which is often overlooked but crucial for performance. In CQRS with ES, the read model is a denormalized data structure optimized for queries, updated asynchronously based on events. This ensures fast data retrieval, complementing the write model used for commands.

##### Implementation Details

- **Read Model Entities**: Simple data structures without business logic, designed for efficient querying.
- **Event Handlers for Read Model**: Subscribe to domain events and update the read model accordingly.
- **Query Handlers**: Retrieve data from the read model for fast responses.

Example from the thinking trace:
```cs
public class OrderReadModel
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int CustomerId { get; set; }
    public decimal Total { get; set; }
    // Other properties for quick access
}
```

Event handler example:
```cs
public class OrderPlacedEventHandler : IEventHandler<OrderPlaced>
{
    private readonly IReadModelRepository _readModelRepository;

    public OrderPlacedEventHandler(IReadModelRepository readModelRepository)
    {
        _readModelRepository = readModelRepository;
    }

    public async Task Handle(OrderPlaced @event)
    {
        var readModel = new OrderReadModel
        {
            Id = @event AggregateId,
            CustomerId = @event.customerId,
            Total = 0 // Initial total
        };
        await _readModelRepository.Add(readModel);
    }
}
```

Query handler example:
```cs
public class GetOrderDetailsQueryHandler : IQueryHandler<GetOrderDetailsQuery, OrderDetails>
{
    private readonly IReadModelRepository _readModelRepository;

    public GetOrderDetailsQueryHandler(IReadModelRepository readModelRepository)
    {
        _readModelRepository = readModelRepository;
    }

    public async Task<OrderDetails> Handle(GetOrderDetailsQuery query)
    {
        var readModel = await _readModelRepository.GetById(query.orderId);
        return new OrderDetails
        {
            Id = readModel.Id,
            CustomerId = readModel.customerId,
            Total = readModel.total
            // Other details
        };
    }
}
```

The thinking trace notes that managing the read model can be complex, as it needs to be kept up-to-date with events, often involving event handlers. This is confirmed by a web search for "challenges of event sourcing with CQRS in .NET," which mentions the need for asynchronous updates to the read model.

#### Benefits and Challenges

- **CQRS Benefits**:
  - Improved performance by optimizing read and write paths separately.
  - Enhanced scalability, as read and write operations can be scaled independently.
- **Event Sourcing Benefits**:
  - Complete audit trail for all state changes.
  - Ability to debug and understand system behavior over time.
  - Support for time-travel queries and versioning of data.
- **Read Model Benefits**:
  - Optimized for fast data retrieval.
  - Scalable independently of the write side.
  - Simple and easy to maintain.

Challenges include managing the read model updates and ensuring event store performance, as noted in the thinking trace and confirmed online.

#### Project Organization and Layers

The thinking trace outlines the project's structure, with CQRS and ES fitting into the following layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains event-sourced entities and domain events.
- **Application Layer**: Handles commands and queries using CQRS, with handlers for each.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements the event store and read model repository.
- **Presentation Layer**: Exposes API endpoints, delegating to command and query handlers.

This structure ensures separation of concerns, with dependencies pointing inward toward the domain layer, adhering to Clean Architecture principles.

#### Practical Implementation Example

The thinking trace provides examples, such as placing an order, which we can expand:

- **Command**: `PlaceOrderCommand` handled by `PlaceOrderCommandHandler`, which creates events like `OrderPlaced`.
- **Event Store**: Persists these events, and the `Order` aggregate is reconstructed by replaying them.
- **Read Model**: Updated by event handlers, ensuring queries like `GetOrderDetailsQuery` are fast.

This aligns with the thinking trace's exploration, ensuring a complete picture.

#### Testing and Deployment Considerations

The thinking trace mentions testing strategies, with unit tests for command and event handlers, and integration tests for the event store and read model. Deployment involves building with `dotnet build --configuration Release`, publishing with `dotnet publish`, and ensuring the event store and read model are configured, as seen in previous sections.
